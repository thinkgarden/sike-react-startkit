### 课程笔记

#### BEM
In summary BEM means:
* Block - A component.
* Element - An element in a component.
* Modifier - Extra styles to create a variant of a component.

#### flexbox
flex-grow: 1; flex-basis: 0 is a useful pattern to create a container that grows to fill its parent, but does not grow bigger than its parent even if there is a lot of content.

#### perfect-scrollbar

    npm install perfect-scrollbar@0.6.4 --save

#### Maintaining the image's aspect ratio
Our default flexbox settings would cause the image to stretch:

![default layout](http://app.sike.io/courses/react/buyshoes-details/product-image-stretch.jpg)

Unfortunately the image is only stretched horizontally (the cross-axis). To scale the image while maintaining the aspect ratio, give the product image an explicit width:

 ![explicit width](http://app.sike.io/courses/react/buyshoes-details/product-image-aspect-scale.jpg)

 Since the image is set to the same width as its container, it doesn't matter whether align-items is center, flex-start, or flex-end.

Note: Why does stretch not maintain the aspect ratio of the image? The algorithm calculates the width following (roughly) these steps:

  1、Determine the intrinsic size of the original image. Use that to calculate the aspect ratio.

  2、Use the width given if specified (e.g. 100%). Otherwise use the intrinsic width.

  3、Scale the image's height to maintain aspect ratio.

  4、Stretch the image's width to be the same as the container's width.

Because stretch happens last, it ignores the image's aspect ratio. If stretch happens before scaling, then the aspect ratio would've been maintained.





#### Margin will break the percentage layout

Even though we are using border-box, the margins of flex items are still added outside of the boxes rather than inside. When using percentage layout, margin could break the layout by adding extra space so the content no longer fit. In our case, if there's margin, two shoes can't fit in the container:

To avoid this issue, use ` padding ` to add space inside the box.


###遇到的问题
text-align:right;无效
图片居中显示:设置display为flex，然后使用justify-content:center;

### 添加transparent overlays

main background

    background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(247,248,250,1),rgba(247,248,250,0));

Shopping Cart Gradient/Transparent Overlays

    .cart__overlay{
      position: absolute;
        top: -50%;
        width: 100%;
        height: 50%;
        background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(192,207,221,0),rgba(192,207,221,1));
    }

###其他
百分比不生效是因为百分比是相对于父元素
父元素没有指定 width 的话就会失效
这和是不是 img 元素没有关系
